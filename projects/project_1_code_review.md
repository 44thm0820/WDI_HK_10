No, it does not mean you can steal someone's code and claim them as your own. It means you can learn a lot from reading (good) code by *stealing* the idea, not just by *copying* (borrowing) the actual code.

Believe it or not, to be a good programmer, you need to read as much code as you are going to write them. The reason is that reading other (good) programmers' code is the best way to learn new technique and new ways to model your ideas.

Your task is to review one of your WDI classmate's project and please present your findings on the following Monday:
- 1 thing that is good about the code
- 1 thing that can be improved
- 2 things which puzzle you in the code and we can let the owner to explain
